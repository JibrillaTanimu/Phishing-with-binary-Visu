In addressing the challenges posed by phishing attacks, we conducted an experimental study incorporating XOR binary visualization and machine learning. This innovative approach seeks to enhance phishing detection by leveraging XOR operations on binary data representations. Through this experiment, we aim to uncover hidden patterns indicative of phishing attempts. The fusion of XOR-generated binary data with machine learning models contributes to a robust analysis, fostering more accurate identification of malicious emails. This research represents a pioneering effort to fortify cybersecurity measures against evolving phishing threats, utilizing a multidimensional strategy for heightened precision and improved defense mechanisms.
